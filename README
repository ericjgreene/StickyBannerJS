Please let me know if this needs any adjustments.  Looks like it hits everything in the requirements but happy to further it to whatever you all would like.

Thanks,

Please create a sticky banner that follow the scrolling.

The requirements:
- The target is a 300x600 banner with blue border on it.
- Red borders are the limit for the banner. Make sure the sticky banner isn't going to overlap those borders.
- Also make it works when the left side's height is shorter than the right side.
- Write all your javascript codes on main.js file. You can use jQuery if you want.
- It's okay to add attributes to existing elements (classes or ids).
